			<p>I created this page after following a marketing tech convergence class, directed by <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/fr" class="link-black"> <strong>Le Wagon</strong></a> web developers. There, I learned the basis of coding on Sublime Text, and this web page is an attempt at coding on my own. </p>

			<h5>Some things about me</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h6>The Cinema Industry</h6>
			<p>
				I have always been fond of movies, and one of my dreams growing up was to work in the cinema industry. In 2020, I had the chance to work for a whole year in two different film distributors, and I now know my goal for post-graduation is to work at the marketing of movies, in theaters or on streaming platforms.

			<h6>My Ocean Side</h6>
			<p>
				Growing up by the sea, near Cherbourg in Normandy, I have always been passionate about any type of water sports and the sea life. I learned how to swim at a very young age and then learned how to sail, surf, and paddle in the British Channel.

			<h6>Family First</h6>
			<p>
				I am very close with my relatives, sisters, parents or cousins. My parents have 3 daughters:
					<ol class="list-inline">
						<li>Constance (24 yo)</li>
						<li>Margaux (22 yo)</li>
						<li>Gersende (18 yo)</li>
					</ol>
				We get along really well and I love gathering with them to spend time and get creative together ! I also consider my very close friends as family.
